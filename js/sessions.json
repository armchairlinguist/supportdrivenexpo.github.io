The tone or attitude you communicate in between the lines is just as important as what you write in black and white, and it can make the difference between a successful, cohesive customer experience and a disjointed, disappointing one. Defining and unifying your voice is even more important when the “you” amounts to several or many people in one support team, all speaking from the same umbrella identity.

When your customers land on your support docs, they should immediately sense that you know where they're coming from and what they need. One of the best ways to create this connection is to dabble in a little professional world-building. By fabricating a small cast of fictional customers to star in your user docs, you can deliver much more powerful self-service experiences. \n\nUser personas have been stock-in-trade for growth teams and information architects for ages. But for self-service, we take it further. Fleshing out those customer personas into individual characters, whose struggles and successes we can use to illustrate our docs, delivers a ton of value: \n- Personal anecdotes and examples, even if they're made up, are way more likely to engage and inform your readers than faceless feature descriptions or abstract use case explanations.\n- Writing about fictional representations of your customers means you're constantly thinking about your actual customers, and what they need from your docs/products/services. \n- Tailoring your docs for your core customers also lets you align your self-service with your company's broader messaging, creating a more seamless customer experience. \n\nThis workshop will guide you, hands-on, through the process of developing a cast of fictional customers and the world they inhabit. We'll also look at specific examples of how to use these personas to make your support docs more engaging, more informative, and ultimately more successful.\n",

Upon recognizing them, they'll be able to start developing ways to control their reaction, and be on the road to building resiliency. \n\nA few sample prompts to cover in a small group: \n- For 60 seconds, continually start and finish this sentence... \"I work most effectively when....\". This prompt helps people get uncomfortable and search inside themselves\n\n- Talking about Observations, Thoughts, Feelings, Wants related to a recent work experience. This helps you understand the difference between a thought and a feeling, with a framework on how to clearly express how you encounter a situation. \n\n- Break into groups of 3 and describe a work challenge that you're facing.
